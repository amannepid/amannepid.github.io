After almost a year of planning a.k.a. laziness, I am finally writing a post on the `Android Studio Plugins` that I use when starting with fresh Android installation.
I will be listing them and giving some quick intro. I hope this will help some and mainly I am trying to make sure that I don't forget them and find the list easily. :blush:

Mostly some of the Plugins mentioned below are for to `make the android development faster` and some are for `lessen up the developer hassle`.

### .gitignore

I am sure by the name of this plugin we developers can know that it's `a plugin for ignoring files in Version Control`. Here are some of its features that I pulled from the original site.

    * Files syntax highlight
    * Coloring ignored files in the Project View
    * Show ignored files by specified ignore file (right click on .gitignore file)
    * Hide ignored files in Project View
    * Suggesting .gitignore file creation for new project
    * Renaming entries from ignore file
    * Close opened ignored files action

### ADB Idea

Are you lazy enough to `clean data`, `uninstall`, `restart app` when you are developing/testing an app? This plugin makes an android developer life easy by making below actions easy:

    * ADB Uninstall App
    * ADB Kill App
    * ADB Start App
    * ADB Restart App
    * ADB Clear App Data
    * ADB Clear App Data and Restart

### String Manipulation

It's another `lovely plugin` which helps you when `working with string` and you wish to have some `faster way of playing with Strings in Android Studio`. It makes easy to `toggle styles of Strings`, `Un/Escape`, `Encode/Decode`, `Increment/Decrement`, `Sort with natural order`, `Align` and so many other stuffs.  :heart: :heart: :heart:

### Key Promoter

If you are a `short-cut key guy *(or even if you are not)*`, then you gonna love this plugin. It will help you setting up the keys and also `will remind you the short-cut` incase you didn't use it. Sometimes you may feel annoying that it keeps reminding you, but trust me its for your own good & you `will fall in love with this` eventually :wink:

### Android ButterKnife Zelezny

If you are an Android Developer I am sure, you are using or must have used the [Butterknife from Jake Wharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife){:target="_blank"}. So this plugin allows one-click creation of Butterknife view injections by creating ButterKnife injections from selected layout XMLs in activities/fragments/adapters.

### Android Color Manager

While we can find lots of `color related plugins`, I am using this Color Manager plugin for my Android Studio. It helps you to do:

    * See all color listed in Color Manager window
    * Drag and drop where you want to copy the color name/tag
    * Edit, Delete, Move, Search colors or colors name

<hr class="post-list__divider ">

Phewwww :sweat:, I think & we all know, we can not include all the plugins in this single post, but these are the basic Andriod Studio Plugins, that I have been using to setup my Android Studio to be development ready. So guys, sorry if I have missed any of your favorite plugins, will try to write some more later.
