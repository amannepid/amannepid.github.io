After long time of `procrastination`, finally I am feeling boost up to write something in my so called `hobby blog`.

```java
package ready.to.blog;

public class StartBlog{

  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }

}
```

You can expect some `Android`, `Java` related stuffs here. Also as I am fan of clean code and good design, I may write some about `Code`, `Productivity`, `Design patterns`, `Design Guidelines` etc. I can't give you the list right now but let's see how I can move later.

Anyways, thanks for you time.
